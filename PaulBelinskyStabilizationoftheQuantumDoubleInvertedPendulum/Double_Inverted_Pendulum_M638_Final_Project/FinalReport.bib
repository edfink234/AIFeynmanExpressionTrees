abstract={A parametrically forced pendulum is studied numerically both with and without friction. In both cases, period-doubling sequences of bifurcation are found. In the dissipative case, the period-doubling sequence leads to strange attractors, while in the conservative case, the sequence is responsible for the destruction of stable zones.},

abstract = {A linear vibrational system with multiple degrees of freedom subjected to parametric excitation is considered. It is assumed that the system is statically unstable but close to a critical point, the excitation amplitude and damping are small, and the excitation frequency is arbitrary. A new stabilization condition is derived in terms of integrals depending on eigenfrequencies and modes of the undisturbed conservative system and the symmetric excitation matrix. As a special case, an approximation for high-frequency excitation is deduced from this condition. Influence of damping on stabilization region is shown to be very small. Two examples for systems with one and two degrees of freedom are presented. It is shown that stabilization of statically unstable systems is possible for low, medium and high excitation frequencies.}

abstract = {The phenomenon of stabilization by parametric excitation of an unstable, elastically restrained double inverted pendulum under its own weight is addressed. The solution is pursued by the Multiple Scale Method, as a perturbation of a critical Hamiltonian system, possessing a zero- and a real frequency. Several asymptotic expansions are carried out, which are able to capture the long-term behavior of the system, for generic (non-resonant) values of the excitation frequency, and some special (resonant) values of excitation-to-natural frequency ratio. It is shown that a proper ordering of the control parameters must be performed, and proper use of integer or fractional power expansions must be made, according to the resonance under study. In particular, a non-standard application of the Multiple Scale Method is illustrated for the 1:1 resonant case, requiring fractional powers and accounting for the ‘arbitrary constants’, generally omitted in regular cases. A comprehensive scenario of the stabilization regions is given in which lower-bound as well as upper-bound curves are evaluated, thus integrating results that recently appeared in the literature.}
